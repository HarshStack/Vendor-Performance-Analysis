# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using data ingestion pipelines, exploratory analysis, and visualization dashboards. The solution integrates data from multiple CSV sources into a structured database, performs performance analysis in Python (Jupyter Notebook), and visualizes insights using Power BI.
