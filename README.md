# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using data ingestion pipelines, exploratory analysis, and visualization dashboards. The solution integrates data from multiple CSV sources into a structured database, performs performance analysis in Python (Jupyter Notebook), and visualizes insights using **Power BI.**

The workflow enables businesses to:

-Automate data ingestion from raw CSV files into a database.

-Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.

-Generate interactive vendor performance dashboards for decision-making.
